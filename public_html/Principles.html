            <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
            <p>
                Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variable. A class is an example of encapsulation as it encapsulates all the data that is member functions, variables, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Calculator program, in all the Python files the methods are Encapsulated under the class. For example:- In calculation.py, class Calculation encapsulates method,__init__(), convert_args_to_list_float(), create(), get_result(). To access any of these methods we will have to call class Calculation and then can access the method.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles all the financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance. Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”. Using encapsulation also hides the data. In this example, the data of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts are hidden from any other section.

            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
            <p>
                Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The benefits of inheritance are:
                1. It represents real-world relationships well.
                2. It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
                3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Calculator program, in every operation file i.e., addition.py, subtraction.py, multiplication.py, division.py the method get_result() is defined with its operations performed in it. And in all the testing files i.e. addition_test.py, subtraction_test.py, multiplication_test.py, division_test.py, that get_result() method is inherited by importing that class in the test class and it is performing the operations which are declared in the normal operation files. So this is the example of Inheritance in the Calculator program.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Different forms of Inheritance:</h4>
            <li>    1. Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called single inheritance. We saw an example above.</li>
            <li>    2. Multiple inheritance: When a child class inherits from multiple parent classes, it is called multiple inheritance. Unlike Java and like C++, Python supports multiple inheritance. We specify all parent classes as a comma-separated list in the bracket.</li>
            <li>    3. Multilevel inheritance: When we have a child and grandchild relationship.</li>
            <li>    4. Hierarchical inheritance More than one derived classes are created from a single base.</li>
            <li>    5. Hybrid inheritance: This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it is a blend of more than one type of inheritance.</li>

            <h2>Abstraction</h2>
            <p>
                An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. An abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation. While we are designing large functional units we use an abstract class. When we want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a component, we use an abstract class.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Calculation program, calculation.py file is using an abstract method. First we have imported the Abstract Method and then we have declared it on the method which we have to make abstract. In this code get_result() is an abstract method. In the main method it is just returning True value. But other files have called that methods to give it its functionality. For Example: in addition.py get_result() is returning sum of the numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                How Abstract Base classes work : By default, Python does not provide abstract classes. Python comes with a module that provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes(ABC) and that module name is ABC. ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract and then registering concrete classes as implementations of the abstract base. A method becomes abstract when decorated with the keyword @abstractmethod.
            </p>
            <p>
                Abstract Class Instantiation : Abstract classes are incomplete because they have methods that have nobody. If python allows creating an object for abstract classes then using that object if anyone calls the abstract method, but there is no actual implementation to invoke. So we use an abstract class as a template and according to the need, we extend it and build on it before we can use it. Due to the fact, an abstract class is not a concrete class, it cannot be instantiated. When we create an object for the abstract class it raises an error.

            <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
            <p>
                What is Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Calculator program, get_result() method is the best example of Polymorphism with Inheritance. Polymorphism means one method having different functionality. In calculator program, get_result is an abstract method which returns nothing in the main file which is calculation.py. But in addition.py it returns the sum of numbers. In subtraction.py it returns the subtraction of numbers. In multiplication.py it returns the multiplication of numbers. In division.py it returns the division of numbers. This is how Polymorphism is used in Calculator program.
            </p>
            <p>
                Polymorphism with Inheritance: In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesn’t quite fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.
